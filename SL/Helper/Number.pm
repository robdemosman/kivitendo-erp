=head1 NAME

SL::Helper::Number - number formating functions formerly sitting in SL::Form

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use SL::Helper::Number qw(all);

  my $str       = _format_number($val, 2); # round to 2
  my $str       = _format_number($val, 2, %::myconfig);                # also works, is implied
  my $str       = _format_number($val, 2, numberformat => '1.000,00'); # with custom numberformat
  my $total     = _format_total($val);     # round to 2
  my $total     = _format_total($val, numberformat => '1.000,00');

  my $val       = _parse_number($str);                             # parse with the current numberformat
  my $val       = _parse_number($str, numberformat => '1.000,00'); # parse with the current numberformat

  my $str       = _round_number($val, 2);
  my $total     = _round_total($val);     # rounded to 2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package contains all the number parsing/formating functions that were
previously in SL::Form.

Instead of invoking them as methods on C<$::form> these are pure functions.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item * C<_format_number VALUE PLACES PARAMS>

The old C<SL::Form::format_amount> with a different signature.

The value is expected to be a numeric value, but undef and empty string will be
vivified to 0 for convinience. Bigints are supported.

For the semantics of places, see L</PLACES>.

If C<params> contains a dash parameter, it will change the formatting of
positive/negative numbers. If C<-> is given for dash, negative numbers will
instead be formatted with prentheses. If C<DRCR> is given, the numbers will be
formatted absolute, but suffixed with the localized versions of C<DR> and
C<CR>.

=item * _format_total

A curried version used for formatting ledger entries. C<myconfig> is set from the
current user, C<places> is set to 2. C<dash> is left empty.

=item * _parse_number VALUE PARAMS

Parses expressions into numbers. C<PARAMS> may contain C<numberformat> just
like with C<L/_format_amount>.

Also implements basic arithmetic interpretation, so that C<2 * 1400> is
interpreted as 2800.

=item * _round_number VALUE PLACES

Rounds a number. Due to the way Perl handles floating point we take a lot of
precautions that rounding ends up being close to where we want. Usually the
internal floats have more than enough precision to not have any floating point
issues, but the cumulative error can interfere with proper formatting later.

For places, see L</PLACES>

=item * _round_total

A curried version used for rounding ledger entries. C<places> is set to 2.

=back

=head1 PLACES

Places can be:

=over 4

=item * not present

In that case a representation is chosen that looks sufficiently human. For
example C<1/10> equals C<.1000000000000000555> but will be displayed as the
localized version of 0.1.

=item * 0

The number will be rounded to the nearest integer (towards 0).

=item * a positive integer

The number will be rounded to this many places. Formatting functions will then
make sure to pad the output to this many places.

=item * a negative inteher

The number will not be rounded, but padded to at least this many places.

=back

=head1 ERROR REPORTING

All of these do not thow exceptions and will simply return undef should
something unforeseen happen.

=head1 BUGS AND CAVEATS

Beware that the old C<amount> is now called plain C<number>. C<amount> is
deliberately unused in the new version for that reason.
