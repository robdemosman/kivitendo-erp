-- When deleting records record_links weren't cleaned up until now
-- This wasn't really a problem apart from the fact that record_links slowly grew
-- but deleting records was seldom enough to not matter
-- Unfortunately delivery_plan decides if an order need to be displayed by the
-- number of record_links, which generates false negatives.
-- so, first clean up the database, and after that create triggers to
-- clean up automatically
